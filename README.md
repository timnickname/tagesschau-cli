# tagesschau-cli
retrieves the first five news-headlines from tagesschau.de.

this is a simple script to work with the tagesschau.de/api2. It retrieves the first 5 headlines of tagesschau.de and puts them out in the command line interface.

i use it on my server, so that everytime i login, i can read the headlines. also features a (clickable) link to the website.

this was a short project of mine and i wanted to share it. it uses curl and jq to determine the elements needed.

feel free to make pull requests if you have a good idea or improvement! i know the code is not optimised, so please feel free to optimise it.

thanks to Brawl345 for documenting the api! https://gist.github.com/Brawl345/d7807f30b2fdcf03333136f1214d6114
